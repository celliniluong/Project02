## Project 02: Payday Game
#### by Cellini Luong


### Overview
This game is focused on the gender wage gap. The narrative of the game features a character who has just graduated college. The game is set in Corporate America with it being the characterâ€™s first day on the job. The gender wage gap is an issue that she has yet to experience herself, but she is determined to advocate and push for an equal paying workplace. To understand how to close the pay gap, she navigates the office. She has conversations with other advocates, completes a pay audit, and takes other actions to educate herself. Her main goal is to rewrite the construct of a male-dominated workplace for all women.

### Technical
In order to create this experience, I used the p5.play library to create sprites and animations. I used the p5.clickable library to create button interactions to complete tasks in between states. I also used the p5.adventure library to create collisions and allow my sprite to move from room to room.
